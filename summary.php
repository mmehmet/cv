		<h3>Summary</h3>
		<p>My greatest strength is in being able to analyse a situation and pull together creative solutions by
            understanding how a wide range of resources work. This means a deeper understanding of the advantages
            (or disadvantages) of one implementation over another and enough knowledge and experience to be able to roll
            up the sleeves and problem-solve when necessity dictates.</p>
		<p>My preferred working environment is <strong>Linux</strong> but my recent experience has been primarily using
            Macs. In the back-end I have built and worked with custom PHP frameworks, but am just as comfortable using
            something like <strong>Laravel</strong>. In the front-end, I have built Wordpress themes/plugins and even
            entire websites with tools like <strong>PHP</strong>, <strong>Typescript</strong>, <strong>React</strong>
            and <strong>NodeJS</strong></p>
        <p>I have a degree in <strong>Mathematics</strong> and a masters in <strong>Cognitive Science</strong> and know
            my way around encryption and deep learning. I built what you are reading, right now. I also have a strong
            interest in emerging technologies and have explored cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and their underlying
            <strong>Blockchain</strong> technology as well as created "AI" algorithms, for fun.</p>
