		<h3>Summary</h3>

		<p>My greatest strength is in being able to analyse any given situation and design creative solutions by applying a wide range of knowledge &mdash; having the experience to understand the advantage/disadvantage of one implementation over another and be able to roll up the sleeves and problem-solve when necessity dictates.</p>

        <p>I studied <strong>Mathematics</strong> and <strong>Cognitive Science</strong> at university and I have always been fascinated with the space where these two subjects intersect &mdash; <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/deep-learning">Deep learning</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/research">AI</a>. I often spend my spare time building AI projects, not just for the fun of it but also to better understand how it all works.</p>

		<p>I have built entire monoliths using <a href="https://www.php.net">PHP</a> frameworks like <a href="https://github.com/laravel/laravel">Laravel</a> and simple microservices made out of <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">Typescript</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node</a>. I have also created themes/plugins for platforms like <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Wordpress</a> and <a href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a> and single-page-apps using <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>.</p>
