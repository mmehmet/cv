		<h3>Summary</h3>
		<p>My greatest strength is in being able to understand how a wide range of resources work in order to analyse
            any situation and put together robust, creative solutions. This comes from a depth of knowledge of the
            advantages/disadvantages of different approaches and the experience and confidence to be able to apply this
            knowledge and get the job done right.</p>
		<p>My preferred working environment is Linux Desktop (<a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>) but my recent
            experience has been primarily using Macs. In the back-end I have worked with a variety of
            <a href="https://www.php.net/releases/8.1/en.php">PHP</a> frameworks, but am most comfortable using
            <a href="https://github.com/laravel/laravel">Laravel</a>. In the front-end, I have built themes/plugins for
            platforms like <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Wordpress</a> and
            <a href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a> and also web apps using tools such as
            <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">Typescript</a>, <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>
            and <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a></p>
        <p>I have a degree in <strong>Mathematics</strong> and know my way around topics such as encryption, Bayes'
            theorem and Fourier analysis, as well as technologies like <strong>Blockchain</strong>. I also have a
            masters in <strong>Cognitive Science</strong> and a strong interest in related subjects, such as
            <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/deep-learning">Deep learning</a> and
            <a href="https://openai.com/research/generative-models">Generative models</a>, and have even created my own
            "AI" algorithms, just for fun.</p>
