		<h3>Summary</h3>
		<p>My greatest strength is in being able to creatively analyse a situation and pull together resources and technologies, sometimes from 'out-of-the-box' places, through an understanding of how they can mesh together. This means a deeper understanding of the advantages (or disadvantages) of one implementation over another and enough knowledge and experience to be able to roll up the sleeves and problem-solve when necessity dictates.</p>
		<p>My preferred environment is <b>Ubuntu</b> Linux (KDE). I can spin up a new server in my sleep. I can build (have built) my own PHP frameworks, but am just as comfortable using popular frameworks, or exploring new ones. In the front end, building Child <b>Wordpress</b> Themes and customising plugins with tools such as <b>CSS3</b> and <b>jQuery</b> is second nature. I have a degree in Math and know my way around strong crypto and authenticated API calls, in the back end. I built what you're reading, right now.</p>
