		<h3>Summary</h3>
		<p>My greatest strength is in being able to analyse a situation and pull together creative solutions by understanding how a wide range of resources work. This means a deeper understanding of the advantages (or disadvantages) of one implementation over another and enough knowledge and experience to be able to roll up the sleeves and problem-solve when necessity dictates.</p>
		<p>My preferred working environment is <b>Ubuntu</b> Linux (KDE). I can spin up a new server in my sleep. I can build (have built) my own PHP frameworks, but am just as comfortable using popular frameworks, or exploring new ones. In the front end, building <b>Wordpress</b> themes and plugins with tools such as <b>PHP</b>, <b>jQuery</b> and <b>AJAX</b> is second nature. I have a degree in Math and know my way around strong crypto and authenticated API calls, in the back end. I built what you're reading, right now.</p>
		<p>I also have a strong interest in emerging technologies beyond the working environment and have explored cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and the underlying Blockchain technology as well as created Machine Learning algorithms, for fun.</p>
